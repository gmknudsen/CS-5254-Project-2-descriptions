# CS-5254-Project-2-descriptions

This project achieves basic functionality in an Android development environment using Kotlin and Android Studio. The completed application, as described in the project description files, allows the user to add "dreams" to a database and add journal entries associated with those dream entries. A user can mark a dream completed or deferred (but not both), and can delete dream entries or an entire dream. It combines multiple activities and fragments, uses a variety of different view components, and dynamically adds and removes objects and information from a database. It also uses LiveData transformations to ensure database access runs on a background thread.
